* Doing a [web pentest](enumeration/web/)? Check out any of these common attacks.
* Do you have the same hype as me with [cloud ](enumeration/cloud/)services and their vulnerabilities?

* Tips for [Android ](mobile/android.md)and [iOS](mobile/ios.md) funsies.
* [Burp Suite ](others/burp.md)is a tool loved by everyone, but you have to know a few tricks, also check my [preferred extensions](others/burp.md#preferred-extensions)
